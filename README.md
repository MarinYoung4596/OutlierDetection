# OutlierDetection

This is an program for outlier Detection.

This project consist of 4 sub-projects, named,

 1. [Generate Random Databse][1]
 2. [Outlier Detection][2]
 3. [Outlier Analysis][3]
 4. [Python Implementation][4]

We **generate a random database** for unit test to get the performance of these algorithms, *Angle-Based Outlier Detection* (ABOD), *Density-Based Outlier Detection* (LOF), and *Distance-Based Outlier Detection* (DBOD).

We **implement** all these algorithms in Visual Studio 2013 based on C# programming language. And use **Outlier Analysis** to analyze the result.

To better understand the program in folder [OutlierDetection], please read the following papers:

 1. [Angle-based Outlier Detection in High-Dimensional Data][5]
 2. [Outlier Detection Techniques][6](p.s. You may find this documents is helpful to you. enjoy :-) )

Techniques Details:
